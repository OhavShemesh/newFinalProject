                <Typography color='black' variant="body1">
                    This website represents my final project, which integrates a full-stack solution. The front-end is developed using React, while the back-end is powered by an Express-based server and a MongoDB database.

                <Typography color='black' variant="body1">
                    The platform includes a comprehensive registration and login system. Users can browse a wide selection of products, view detailed product information, add items to their cart, and complete their purchase. Additionally, there is a search feature and category filter that helps customers easily find products. Each product's availability is clearly displayed, showing the number of items in stock, as well as indicating when an item is out of stock.

                <Typography color='black' variant="body1">
                    On the cart page, customers have the option to remove items from their cart, making it easier to manage their selections before completing the purchase.

                <Typography color='black' variant="body1">
                    Customers can also send messages directly to management via the contact page, eliminating the need for external communication methods such as email or WhatsApp.

                    For business customers, the site offers an exclusive business board where managers can add, update, and delete products. Additionally, managers have the ability to change the status of orders, offering enhanced control and flexibility in managing customer orders.
